Note:
There is a known issue with MacOS missing OpenSSL libraries. This can be addressed
by installing OpenSSL via HomeBrew and symlinking the installed libraries to their
expected locations.

brew install openssl@1.1
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib libssl.1.1.dylib
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.1.dylib libcrypto.1.1.dylib
